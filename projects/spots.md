Spots is a web application designed to help UH Manoa students discover and share study locations on and around campus. As a student at UH Manoa, I understand the challenge of finding suitable study spots that match individual preferences and needs. Our team developed this application to create a community-driven platform where students can find, rate, and share study locations.

## My Contribution
As a member of the development team, I focused on implementing several key features:
- Developed the check-in system allowing users to indicate their presence at a location
- Created the busyness indicator functionality to show real-time spot occupancy
- Implemented Spot cards, ability to add new spots, and filter spot search system
- Built API endpoints for managing user check-ins and spot busyness data
- Contributed to the profile page development and user interface design
