Dream Flip is a 2D pixel platformer developed in Unity. For this project, I worked alongside another programmer and was responsible for movement controls, health loss and regenration, and gravity controls. We worked with an artist to create original charachters and animations to match the games narrative. I worked on incorporating the art assets and animations into the game. We focused on creating a game that was both challenging and engagning.


Here is some code that illustrates how we read values from the line sensors:

```cpp
byte ADCRead(byte ch)
{
    word value;
    ADC1SC1 = ch;
    while (ADC1SC1_COCO != 1)
    {   // wait until ADC conversion is completed   
    }
    return ADC1RL;  // lower 8-bit value out of 10-bit data from the ADC
}
```
