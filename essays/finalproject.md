# Final Project Idea: Spots
**Proposers:** Arissa Dang, Rylee Au, Zelda Cole

## Overview
As college students, we share the struggle of finding a nice spot to study, hangout, relax, or meet new people. In addition, some unicorn places heard about from a friend of a friend are hard to find and might not even be worth the effort and time to get there. We will create a guide to spots on and around campus including a map, descriptions, photos, amenities, a rating system based on quietness, crowd levels, social opportunities, etc. Students can easily find, add, and rate spots, fostering a community of interaction and academic success.

## Approach
To use the application, students must create an account and set up their profiles. With these profiles, students can list their major, courses, year, and interests so that it’s easier to find those with similarities. There could also be a friend/following system that will help students to build trust and friendship with one another. Users must use their hawaii.edu email addresses to confirm that they are students at UH for safety concerns. In order to find the optimal study spots, there could be a map of cafe locations, as well as a rating system for each spot that gives the details on volume levels, seating, ambiance, hours, and general ideas of how “study friendly” the areas are.

## Project Goals
- To find cafes/places that are both study friendly, and have good food and drinks :)
- Encourage collaboration between peers outside of school, hopefully opening up opportunities to become more than just classmates

## Mockup Pages
- **Profile Page:** Users can input their preferences for study spaces and it can showcase personal history or study stats.
- **Home Page:** Overview of study spaces for popular spots or recently visited locations based on proximity to the user.
- **Map Page:** Interactive map to show real-time availability and how far away study locations are from the user.
- **Spot Details:** Individual pages for each spot with detailed information (ex. description, photos, reviews, capacity, amenities, noise levels, parking, ect.)
- **Favorites:** Users can save their favorite study spots and it can suggest new study spots based on their favorites.
- **New Spot Page:** Allow users to add new spots that they find and input location details.

## Use Cases

- **A user wants to find a place to meet with friends:** The user can look at the nearby map page and apply filters so they can make sure there are spots to accommodate the group.
- **Students want to coordinate a study meet-up:** The student picks a space based on recommendations and invites their friends to join them.
- **A student finds a new spot they want to add:** They add a spot and input the location details (ex. capacity, location, hours. ect.) and add it to their favorites.
- **A user wants to rate a spot they visited:** The user can input their spot ratings for each category (ex: quietness, crowd levels, social opportunity, etc.) to be factored into the average ratings for that spot to be displayed in the spot details.

## Beyond the Basics
After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:
- A rating system for each spot regarding quietness, crowd levels, social opportunity, etc.
- Map-based interface to indicate where each spot is located
- A more advanced and interactive map that extends farther beyond campus
- Crowd predictions that tell what times the spots are busiest
- Events or promotions that could allow more traction for local cafe owners
