When you hear “coding standards,” it’s easy to think of them as a set of arbitrary rules—whether to use tabs or spaces, or how to format braces. While these details help maintain uniformity in a codebase, they only scratch the surface of what coding standards truly represent. To me, coding standards are not just about aesthetics; they are the foundation of software quality. They teach, guide, and establish a shared language within a team.

## Standard for Learning

It might not seem obvious at first, but coding standards are an invaluable tool for learning a new programming language. When I first started coding, I didn’t know the “right” way to write something. It felt like I was trying to speak a new language without understanding its grammar. Coding standards act as a grammatical ruleset for programming, helping you express ideas in the most effective and idiomatic way possible.

For instance, using ESLint in a TypeScript project is like enrolling in a crash course on best practices. Initially, my entire code was underlined with red squiggles—each one a lesson in disguise. Every rule that ESLint enforced pushed me towards better habits, helping me internalize the nuances of the language faster. It was like having a tutor constantly pointing out areas for improvement as I coded.

## Frustration Turned to Appreciation

After spending a week working with ESLint in VSCode, I had moments where it felt like it was just nitpicking details that didn’t matter. I was focused on whether my code would run properly, and the constant corrections seemed more of a hindrance than a help. But every error I fixed taught me something new about the language or about writing better code overall. As I continued working with ESLint, I noticed it was transforming the way I wrote code. I began preemptively writing code that adhered to the standards, which reduced the number of errors and made my work more enjoyable. What started as a frustrating experience evolved into valuable learning.

## Why Do They Matter?

In a team setting, coding standards ensure that everyone is on the same page. This consistency makes it easier to read, understand, and collaborate on the code, reducing the likelihood of introducing new bugs. But the impact of coding standards extends beyond collaboration. They play a crucial role in the long-term health of a project. Code that follows consistent standards is easier to maintain and refactor, which is essential as projects grow in complexity. Without these standards, a codebase can quickly become chaotic, making it difficult to add new features or fix issues without unintended side effects. Coding standards act as a safeguard against this, helping to keep the codebase clean and organized as it evolves.

## The Foundation of Quality Software

Coding standards are the foundation of quality software development. They’ve helped me learn the intricacies of programming languages and ensured that my code remains maintainable over time. My experience with ESLint and VSCode has solidified my belief in the power of coding standards. What may start as a frustrating set of rules can ultimately lead to a deeper understanding and a more rewarding coding experience.
